/**
 * Dynamic typing
JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
